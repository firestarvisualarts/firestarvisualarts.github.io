<span class="headline">Beautiful Lie</span>
<p><span class="subhead">By Cheyenne Clardy</span><br></p>
		
<p>People only love me when <br>
I'm not at peace, <br>
because the me on the outside is a beautiful lie.<br>
This facade keeps the pieces patched together.<br>
At least until I can go home and sew it,<br>
And make it whole again.<br>
This wear and tear has become<br>
Harder to mend when your<br>
Need to keep it together is <br>
a means of short term survival.<br>
</p>      

<p>A smile all day keeps my tears at bay.<br>
The ability to lie is stronger than my <br>
Will to let go of this pride<br>
And cry. <br>
But more than anything, <br>
Confess my desire to die. <br>
</p>

<p>People love me more when I am not<br>
The problem - a burden.<br>
Preaching reassurance<br>
When I continue to fail at practicing it.<br>
"Why am I trapped in a beautiful lie?"<br>
Perhaps I fear that the ugly truth<br>
Will reap the rest of my youth.<br>
Circle of "friends" fading to black<br>
Becoming the mist and fog in my dreams.<br>
Along with that thin thread holding<br>
My sanity -<br>
Finally breaking...<br>
</p>

<p>To think giving everyone this beautiful lie is so normal.<br>
Feeding everyone a fallacy <br>
Just to prevent me from losing <br>
The remaining bits of my stability.<br>
</p>
