<p><span class="subhead">By Cheyenne Clardy</span><br></p>
		
<p>Forsaken and abandoned <br>
By society <br>
My life has been spent giving reverence to<br>
My deity, my family, my country. <br>
Pure in body and thought.<br>
I devoted my all to you.<br>
Sadly, I was wrong for hoping <br>
You would help me as I helped you.<br>
</p>

<p>Used, abused and defiled by man.<br>
In my own home, a club,<br>
A dorm room, a car, it didn't matter where.<br>
My world is imploding all around me <br>
As my cries are left unanswered. <br>
Or worse, no recollection <br>
Of what had occurred.<br>
The one who I have given <br>
Everything to<br>
decided to condemn me to purgatory.<br>
</p>

<p>Report to the authorities <br>
Or refuse to tell a soul,<br>
I am doomed to relive the night<br>
Of being violated.<br>
A part of me was taking from me -<br>
Rendering me powerless.<br>
</p>

<p>Now I am being told, "I wanted it".<br>
"You tempted them" to revoke your consent.<br>
Taking me by force.<br>
I am a victim, a statistic of the abused.<br>
Enraged by everything that<br>
Has not protected me but <br>
Participated in the abuse.<br>
</p>
		
<p>If I rise from the ashes,<br>
Bloodied and angry <br>
Ready to take everyone down with me<br>
I am deemed the bad guy.<br>
</p>
