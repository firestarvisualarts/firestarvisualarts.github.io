<span class="headline">Darkened Waters</span>
<p><span class="subhead">By Cheyenne Clardy</span><br></p>

<p>Where is the path to shore?<br>
When I am engulfed by these waters.<br>
My feet cannot touch the ground<br>
Yet all I can do is remain calm<br>
Or sink...slowly into the depths.<br>
</p>

<p>Holding my breath -<br>
The depths of the blackened abyss.<br>
My words are muted, and even my <br>
Thoughts that I swore had its own <br>
Voice in my head has been silenced.<br>
The demented who plugged my ears,<br>
And gagged me<br>
 Have already begun to pursue me.<br>
</p>

<p>Dragging me, and pulling me<br>
Down by my throat<br>
There seems to be no escape -<br>
When your sense of certainty<br>
Is deprived by the weights <br>
Of the tangled kelp, <br>
And anchor latched into my ankle<br>
It reaps every choice I could ever fathom.<br>
</p>
		
<p>In these darkened waters,<br>
I can only hold my<br>
Breath and grasp for this sliver <br>
Of hope -<br>
Or scream, desperately for freedom<br>
And drown in the merciless silence.<br>
