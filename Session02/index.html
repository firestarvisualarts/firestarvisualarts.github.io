<div><p class="colorfultext"><b>Perfect for my classroom!</b></p>
	
  <p>I bought these after seeing Jen Jones (@helloliteracy) post about them holding her Kids A-Z books. They perfectly hold six books and the lesson plan to go with it. They keep their slim look and you can store them vertically or horizontally. They are of good quality and I will definitely purchase again!</p>
	
	
	<p class="colorfultext"><b>Teacher MUST HAVE for organization!</b></p>
	
  <p><i>I LOVE</i> these for storing my math centers and small group materials! They are sturdy and have all continued to hold up and work well after frequent use. The little pocket allows for a description of what is inside each envelope. I love them so much I bought a second set just like them!</p>
	
	
	<p class="colorfultext"><b>Durable!</b></p>
	
  <p>These envelopes are durable and hold up great for centers in kindergarten! They are not slippery like plastic zip bags, so storage is easier and they fit into a file cabinet or storage container with no difficulties. Smaller pieces can easily fit inside along with standard size paper. I also like the pocket on the outside for labeling purposes. I use a color-coding system in my class for subjects, so the multiple colors works well. My only wish is that this product came in singular colors, as I need more of certain colors than others.</p>
	
	
	<p class="colorfultext"><b>PERFECT SIZE for paper scraps - large or small</b></p>
	
  <p>I like these for the purpose I bought them for ... BUT, one package was <i>ONE SHORT</i> of the 24 count, and one was missing the little zip thingie to open/close it. The plastic material is somewhat durable, but I think over time will probably crack or rip at the side seams...only time will tell. FOR NOW, they are very useable and will serve my purposes of organizing papers and scraps to be easily seen for use. I like the size of them and the colored zip closures will allow me to designate those colors to the papers in them. I hope to get my monies worth out of them but do not think I would purchase them again though.</p>
	
	
	<p class="colorfultext"><b>If you love Home Edit you will love these!</b></p>
	
  <p>So if you have watched the <i>Home Edit </i>and become a little obsessed like myself then these are great. They have the rainbow colors and are clear. I took all my contents from my important papers drawer (that I just organized after this show) and have organized things into these pouches by type. Example is for the first time in 13 years of marriage when my husband recently needed the title to one of our vehicles I was easily able to go directly to my <i>Titles</i> pouch and lay my hands directly on what he needed in no time. Now to just finish organizing everything little by little.</p>
