<span class="headline">Pride Month Cosplay Photoshoot</span>
	
<p><span class="subhead">June 26, 2021</span></p>
	
<p> The word <i>cosplay</i> is a Japanese portmanteau of the English words <b>costume</b> and <b>play</b>. In this hobby, the participants dress up as their favorite fictional characters. These can be characters from anime, manga, cartoons, video games, comic books, and more. Sometimes, a person cosplays an <i>OC</i>, which stands for <b>original character</b>. OCs do not come from any publications, they are designed by either the cosplayer themselves, or an artist. Cosplayers meet up at conventions and photoshoots, where they can show off their outfits. For most, it is just a hobby. Something fun that can be likened to gardening or playing video games. But for some, it's a business. Fans of a cosplayer can support them by subscribing to premium websites like OnlyFans and Patreon.</p>

<p>This past Saturday, I hosted a Pride themed cosplay photoshoot with a friend. The requirements were very relaxed, the only major one being that the participant needed to incorporate Pride somehow. I bought a bag of 72 Pride flags off the internet, and gave them out to participants. However, most brought their own gear. Many cosplayers happen to be part of the LGBTQ+ community. It took place at Madison Square Park, and went from 1 PM to 8 PM, with a little party afterwards. The weather wasn't too great though. It was hot and humid, and it rained twice. Every time it rained, we had to take cover under a large tree at the park. There were about 20 of us in total, and around 15 at any given time.</p> 
	
<p>The reason I wanted to hold this event, was to do something good in cosplay. LGBTQ+ rights are very important to me, as well as other social issues. Even though cosplay is a Japanese invention, those who are not White and Cishet still experience discrimination. Unfortunately, those with darker skin have it the worst. This is the second cosplay event that I have attended that raised awareness for a social issue. The first was a memorial for Darien Hunt last summer, a Black cosplayer who was killed by police in Saratoga Springs back in 2014. Since I do not have all the info, I advise those who are interested to do their own research.</p>
	
<p>Aside from racism, there are other issues currently plaguing the cosplay community. <i>Cosplay is not Consent</i> is a campaign to spread awareness of issues relating to <b>sexual harassment</b>. Women at cons who show skin often have to deal with creepy men who touch them or take photos without their consent. <b>Drama</b> and <b>gatekeeping</b> are also huge problems. Since cosplay is a hobby that <b>relies on money</b>, those that don't have as much are often <b>ridiculed</b> or told to <b>leave</b> the community. Like within the fashion industry, another issue is <b>fatphobia</b>, where cosplayers who are not thin get <b>bullied</b>. To try and combat all of these issues, the <i>Cosplay is for Everyone</i> campaign was started. With all this negativity, I wanted to instead do something positive for the community.</p>

<p><b>Cosplay is supposed to be fun, so let's keep it that way.</b></p>
