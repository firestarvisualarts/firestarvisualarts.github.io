<p><span class="subhead">By Cheyenne Clardy</span><br></p>

<p>Everyone forgets that monsters do exist.<br>
The lovely word people describe beings in dreams.<br>
Hiding under childrens beds, <br>
Lurking and creeping in the shadows, <br>
Stalking their victims before tearing into their bodies.<br>
</p>


<p>The pleasure of screams, and cries echo in every scenery<br>
The scent of sweat, and the sight of crimson <br>
decorate every surface - <br>
Flowing slowly, slowly.<br>
No one would believe any citizen <br>
of the world would commit such atrocities<br>
Would someone be capable of wanton violence?<br>
</p>


<p>Treading among large crowds,<br>
Creeping in the shadows or in plain sight.<br>
A psychological game<br>
Played with everyone that crosses their path.<br>
Friend, family, foe or stranger?<br>
Their facade is a beautiful disguise. <br>
Humans then realize they are their own monsters <br>
And creators of the thing that kills them<br>
</p>


<p>The world is their hunting ground <br>
and everyone is their victim<br>
Or conspirator.<br>
</p>


<p>Hungry for human flesh,<br>
Leaving bruises and welts on their skin.<br>
Burying people alive,<br>
Dressed up as clowns - <br>
Leaving lingering mental scars on them all<br>
Playing copy cat and recreating it all<br>
Or abusing their privileges- <br>
their access to weapons of destruction<br>
Broiling rage and hatred guides <br>
them into painting every school,<br>
Mall, home, church, and land with lead <br>
and red. <br>
Never ending monstrosities, <br>
and trauma clashing like fallen dominoes<br>
Nothing is ever spared <br>
when abuse comes in vast forms. <br>
</p>

 
<p>But why do people associate monsters with the ethereal, <br>
the ugly beings,<br>
Abominations forged by other worldly forces;<br>
When all you have to do is look in the mirror <br>
And see you. <br>
